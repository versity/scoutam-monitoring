# Introduction #

The `scoutam-monitoring` repository includes example monitoring scripts and configurations for monitoring node status with Nagios and visualizing metrics with Grafana.

*These scripts and configuration examples are provided as-is. Feel free to modify them as needed to suite your ScoutAM system.*

If you have a current subscription agreement, Versity support will assist you with setup based on what has been tested internally. Versity does not provide support for 3rd party software including Nagios, NRPE, Grafana, Prometheus, etc.
